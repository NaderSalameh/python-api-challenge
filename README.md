# python-api-challenge

This repository displays plots and analysis on current weather conditions of over 500 random cities pulled from a weather api.

In addition to the analysis, while using google maps, I was able to plot the humidity of each city using a heat layer. 

Finally, I chose my own perfect weather condition preference (temp between 75 and 85 degrees Fahrenheit with 0 clouds), located those coordinates that match my preference,  passed those coordinates through the Google API, then pinned the closest hotels to those coordinates on the map displayed.
